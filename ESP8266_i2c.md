### Summary of pin behaviour

| Pin # | Name | Usual Function| Usually Low| Pulled | PWM | i2c| interrupt| High at Boot| Boot if pulled low/high|
| ---| ---| ---            | --- | ---  | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---       |
| 16 | D0 | Wake           | yes |      |  no | no  | no  | yes |           |
|  5 | D1 | SCL            |     |      | yes | yes | yes |     |           |
|  4 | D2 | SDA            |     |      | yes | yes | yes |     |           |
|  0 | D3 | Boot  / Flash  |     | high | yes | yes | yes |     | low fails |
|  2 | D4 | onboard LED    |     | high | yes | yes | yes | yes | low fails |
| 14 | D5 | SCK            |     |      | yes | yes | yes |     |           |
| 12 | D6 | MISO           |     |      | yes | yes | yes |     |           | 
| 13 | D7 | MOSI           |     |      | yes | yes | yes |     |           | 
| 15 | D8 | SS             | yes | low  | yes | yes | yes | yes | high fails|
|  3 | RX | USB            |     |      | yes | yes | yes | yes |           |
|  1 | TX | USB            |     |      | yes | yes | yes | yes | low fails |
|    | A0 | ADC0  0-1V     |     |      |  no | no  | no  |     |           |

When you attach an external device and it pulls a pin high or low when powered on, make sure this does not conflict with boot behaviour of ESP8266.
