# Airquality Sensors with ESP8266
The goal of this project is to connect several air quality sensors via i2c bus to a wireless microcontroller.

There exisits many sensor for indoor air quality (see below). If individual gas concentration needs to be meausred, usualy a metal oxid sensor needs to be heated for a brief time. Power consmpution will be high and the system should be run using an AC adapter. For humidity, tempterauter and pressure, the system can run from a battery.

The hardware includes a 3.3V to 5V with voltage level shifter and an ESP8266.
At this time the software supports the following devices:
- LCD 20x4  (requires 5V signal and power)
- SCD30 Senserion CO2  
- BME680 Bosch Temp, Humidity, Pressure, VOC  
- BM[E/P]280 Bosch Temp, [Humidity], Pressure  
- SGP30 Senserione VOC, eCO2  
- CCS811 Airquality eCO2 tVOC  
- SPS30 Senserion particle, requires 5V power, compatible with 3.3V logic signals
- MLX90614 Melex temp contactless  
- MAX30105 Maxim pulseox (in progress)

The system displays the measured values on an LCD and also connects to an MQTT server and publish results. When connection is lost, it scans for available networks and reasblishes the connection,

The software currenlty supports 3 separate i2c buses. Some breakout boards affect the proper operation of others boards. For example LCD display corrupts within 12-24hrs time frame when it shares bus with many sensors. SPS30 does not properly reset after program upload when LCD driver is on the same bus. MLX sensor sometimes reports excessive or negative temperature when combined with other senors.

The software scans all availabel pins for i2c devices and records the pin configuration for the supported sensors.

Most settings are stored in EEPROM and can be changed at runtime.

## Air Quality Assessments
The sensor readings are compared to expected range and LCD backlight flashes if readings are otuside recommended range. Those ranges are:
* Pressure:  
A change of 5mbar within in 24hrs can cause headaches in suseptible subjects. The program computes the avaraging filter coefficient (a) based on the sensor sample interval for a 24hr smoothing filter y = (1-a)\*y + a*x
* CO2:  a value >1000ppm is poor
* Temperature:  20-25.5C is normal range
* Humidity:  30-60% is normal range
* Particles:  
P2.5: >25ug/m3 is poor  
P10: >50ug/m3 is poor   
* tVOC:  a value >660ppb is poor
